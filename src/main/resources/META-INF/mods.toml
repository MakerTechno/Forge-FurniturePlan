# IGNORE_ALL_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the client or the server. This is a special case and should only be used if your mod has no server component.
# NONE means that no display test is set on your mod. You need to do this yourself, see IExtensionPoint.DisplayTest for more information. You can define any scheme you wish with this value.

-What is Furniture Plan Alpha?
Furniture Plan Alpha is a mod written by MakerTechno(also called Maker or Maker[ERROR]),
including kinds of furniture and some interesting changes.
These changes make minecraft funnier and not so boring.
When you need many pickaxe to mine but not much iron you have.
(Using cooper and change it to *brass!)
Furniture include chairs, tables and so on.
Most of the model were made by [NotCurrentGameID]jing_qi and me.
code and most textures by me, MakerTechno.

-How this mod came out?
Hmm.... Just one day, we logged in the server, play for a while,
then jing_qi found that the game needs more furniture for his beautiful house.
Also, he needs more quartz but he used over his iron ingots for the pickaxes, he didn't want to find more.
He found many cooper but no more iron...maybe we can change it to a new material and make a pickaxe?(Well, pure copper is not very hard)
Then it comes, The brass refiner(Actually, it was not made yet).
